# liquidhandling

This repository contains the source code for a python library developed to allow programmatic control of the Hudson Robotics systems installed in Argonne National Laboratory's Secure BIO Lab.

This library is currently in **active development**. As such, there are no guarantess of API stability, feature completeness, or test coverage. Any code generated by this library should be considered untested, and when run on the physical lab automation systems should be carefully monitored.

## Installation

  git clone https://github.com/AD-SDL/hudson-liquidhandling.git
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install -e .


## Documentation

Documentation for the interfaces contained in this library can be found in the `docs` directory. In addition, example code is available under `example`.

### Tests

* Run all: `python -m pytest ./test` in the repo's root directory (or with the last argument adjusted to point to the `test` directory)

### Formatting the Code

To automatically format the code for style and readability, run `black .` in the repo's root directory. This keeps all python code stylistically consistent.
