-------------------------------------------
Serial Dilution Protocol for 384 Well Plate
-------------------------------------------
Treatment performed in duplicate by row (ex. A1 and B1 are duplicates)

----------------
SOLO DECK LAYOUT
----------------
Position 1: Media resevoir (96 deep well containing media)
Position 2: Empty
Position 3: 180 uL tips (starts empty)
Position 4: Assay plate (starts empty)
Position 5: Culture stock plate (96 deep well, containing stock cells)
Position 6: Treatment serial diluton plate (empty 96 deep well)
Position 7: Culture dilution plate (empty 96 deep well)
Position 8: Treatment stock plate (96 deep well containing treatment)

Stack 1: Empty
Stack 2: Empty
Stack 3: Empty tip box storage (empty at start)
Stack 4: Full tip box replacements (1 for every 2 plate quadrants)
Stack 5: 384 well clear flat bottom plate with lid (1 for every 4 plate quadrants)



-----------------
REQUIRED VOLUMES
-----------------
Media resevoir: ~1.5 mL media per well
Culture stock: ~100uL stock per well
Treatment stock: ~500 uL (approx. 250 + dead volume)

-------
TO RUN
-------
The following is an example command line entry to execute the protocol. Each argument will execute the protocol
for one quadrant of the plate (6 cols) (The example will execute the protocol for all 4 quadrants, or the entire plate)

python main.py -tr col1 col2 col3 col4 -cc 1 2 3 4 -mc 1 3 5 7 -tdh 1 2 1 2 -cdc 1 2 3 4



-tr: treatment location, which column of the treatment stock plate will be dispensed into the current quadrant of the plate (ex col1 to be dispensed in plate quadrant 1)
-cc: culture column, which column of the cell stock plate will be dispensed into the current quadrant of the plate
-mc media start column, first column the protocol will aspirate from for the current quadrant. Entire quadrant uses 2 columns of media
-tdh: treatment dilution half, indicates whether the treatment serial dilution is made on the first (1) or second (2) half of the serial dilution plate
IMPORTANT: for now, if more than 2 quadrants being made, must swap out the serial dilution plate every 2 quadrants manually
-cdc: culture dilution column, which column of the culture dilution plate will be used to dilute the stock cells

-The python script executed in order to run the protocol

generate_SD_384_repeatable: function which executes all liquid handling and softlinx steps, takes in above arguments

Line 56: Argument error checking
Line 74: Variable list (see comments in main.py)
Line 167: generation of each hso file in protocol
Line 253: Implimentation of the softlinx pipeline
Line 302: Execution of hso files (liquid handling)
Line 428: hourly scan of plate every hour for 12 hours
Line 463: Save and export protocol
Line 468: Data sent to lambda6

find_treatment_loc: function allowing program to parse -tr argument as treatment locations

main: main function adding command line arguments and executing generate_SD_384_repeatable

functions.py
------------
- Python script which houses all of the liquid handling protocols to be executed by the Hudson Solo

generate_media_transfer_to_quarter_assay_hso: aspirates media from media resevoir and dispenses into every well in current quadrant of assay plate

generate_fill_culture_dilution_and_treatment_plates_with_media_hso: aspirates media from media resevoir and dispenses into culture dilution, and aspirates cells from culture stock plate and dispenses into culture dilution

generate_add_diluted_cells_to_assay_loop_hso: aspirates diluted cells from culture dilution plate and dispenses ino current quadrant of assay plate

generate_serial_dlution_treatment_hso: Dispesnes media into current half of serial dilution plate, adds treatment to first column, and performs serial dilution

generate_add_antibioitc_to_assay_hso: adds treatment from serial dilution plate to corresponding column of assay plate
