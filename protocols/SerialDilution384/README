-------
TO RUN
-------
The following is an example command line entry to execute the protocol. Each argument will execute the protocol
for one quadrant of the plate (6 cols) (The example will execute the protocol for all 4 quadrants, or the entire plate)

python main.py -tr col1 col2 col3 col4 -cc 1 2 3 4 -mc 1 3 5 7 -tdh 1 2 1 2 -cdc 1 2 3 4



-tr: treatment location, which column of the treatment stock plate will be dispensed into the current quadrant of the plate (ex col1 to be dispensed in plate quadrant 1)
-cc: culture column, which column of the cell stock plate will be dispensed into the current quadrant of the plate
-mc media start column, first column the protocol will aspirate from for the current quadrant. Entire quadrant uses 2 columns of media
-tdh: treatment dilution half, indicates whether the treatment serial dilution is made on the first (1) or second (2) half of the serial dilution plate
IMPORTANT: for now, if more than 2 quadrants being made, must swap out the serial dilution plate every 2 quadrants manually
-cdc: culture dilution column, which column of the culture dilution plate will be used to dilute the stock cells
