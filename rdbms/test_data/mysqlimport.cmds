# For plate records
# 
# When inserting a source plate, here are the things to 
# consider.
# 
# - It only has to be inserted once. This is the persistent 
#   record of what is in that source plate.
# 
# - The plate table is updated
#         plate id = insert into plate type=source
#         barcode = 'filename' thus a file name must be unique
#                   to one plate
# - The source_plate table is updated for each well
#         insert into source_plate type='bacteria' 
#                   Shared connection to lambda6.cels.anl.gov closed.
